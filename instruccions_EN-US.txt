First of all, thank you very much for downloading this plugin for free!



You're welcome, but I want to know how to use it...

-First, you have to insert the "addons" folder in the root directory of your Godot project.

-Then, activate the plugin in the project options, in the "Plugins" tab, the name of the plugin will appear, change the "status" option to "active" or "active";

-From now on, you already have a new node available in your project, called "dynamic water", being able to add it to the scene.



Nice, but nothing appears!!

-Nothing is displayed yet because you need to change the "WIDTH" and "HEIGHT" options.



Okay!! now just run the scene and...

-Take it easy, young man!! If you go to run it, all you'll see is just a static white block.

-To improve the appearance of the water, change the "COLOR" property of the water, so that it is transparent and blue.



Now run the scene and...

-Wait!! it lacks the physical properties of water!!;

- TENSION: Changes the elasticity of the water;

- DAMPING: Changes how fast the water loses energy;

- PASSES: Changes the number of vertices that the energy will disperse;

- DISPERSION: Changes the amount of energy that will be scattered;



Now there are no more properties missing, so I can run it and... The water is not moving?

-The water does not move because the only way water interacts is through bodies of the RigidBody2D class,
because wave displacement variables are computed using RigidBody2D's unique linear velocity;

-Yes now!! By running the scene and somehow placing a RigidBody2D with collision, by "plunging" into the water, it will form ripples that will behave differently based on physical properties.
